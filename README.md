The repo of the new interpreted language i'm working on. All the test code files are in ./src/tests/code. The file extension, '.reix', which I called REI executable is the extension of the language. REI is called Recursive Execution Interpreter which me and YapGPT came up with. It kinda makes sense given the interpreter is a treee-walk AST interpreter but not really but it sounds cool.
