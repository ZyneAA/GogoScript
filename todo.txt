// Optimization
1. Instead of slicing the whole source string on every call of advance() and peek(),
make a source: Vec<char> so that it wont be O(n) because of unicode-8 encoding
(This is kinda on Rust part. Because Rust's &str are not array of char.
Instead they are array of bytes, u8). So instant lookup time would be much better in the future.

// Comeback later
in parser::Parser::primary(), add a proper error handling for else case

// Error Synchronization improvement
instead of exiting the process, make a better error handling
