// Optimization
1. Instead of slicing the whole source string on every call of advance() and peek(),
make a source: Vec<char> so that it wont be O(n) because of unicode-8 encoding
(This is kinda on Rust part. Because Rust's &str are not array of char.
Instead they are array of bytes, u8). So instant lookup time would be much better in the future.

// Important kinda
Lifetimes are rlly pain in the as* when it comes to dealing with function in REI. Now it it cloning every thing on function.

// Comeback later
in parser::Parser::primary(), add a proper error handling for else case (done)

// Proper error report in resolver.rs

// uhmm print and println impl?? (done)

// Error Synchronization improvement
instead of exiting the process, make a better error handling
make crazy error reports (kinda)

// To add later maybe?
add support for comparing of different types

// GOING BATSHIT CRAZY
- OWN VIRTUAL ENV FOR CODE EXECUTION
- MANUAL MEMORY ALLOCATION
- INVOKING C LIBRARY FOR FUN???
- NO GC
- jit compiler?
